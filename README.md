Predicting Stock Prices with Deep Neural NetworksÂ¶
This project walks you through the end-to-end data science lifecycle of developing a predictive model for stock price movements with Alpha Vantage APIs and a powerful machine learning algorithm called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By completing this project, you will learn the key concepts of machine learning / deep learning and build a fully functional predictive model for the stock market, all in a single Python file.# Stock_Prediction
